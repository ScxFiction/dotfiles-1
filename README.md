# saltstack-dotfiles
My personal dotfiles, coordinated by SaltStack

## Prerequisites
You must have `wget` installed. Everybody has that installed though, right?

## Disclaimer
I need to find a nicer way of managing the 4k configuration which is "augmented" on-top of the regular configuration.

That being said, everything does work; though it is pretty Ubuntu specific, as I've never really bothered to make it work for much else.

## Configure Everything
```
./init.sh
```

## Configure A Single State
```
./init.sh <state-name>
```
